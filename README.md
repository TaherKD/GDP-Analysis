# GDP-Analysis

Personal project to get a hands-on of Data Sourcing, Data Cleaning, Uni-variate Analysis, Segmented Uni-variate Analysis, Bi-variate Analysis, and Derived Metrics.

The data is sourced from https://data.gov.in/ - an Open Government Data (OGD) platform of India. The data for GDP Analysis of Indian States is divided into two parts:

1. Data I-A: This dataset contains the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) data for the states and union territories.

2. Data I-B: This dataset contains the distribution of GSDP among three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry), and the tertiary sector (services) along with taxes and subsidies. There is separate dataset for each of the states. 

There are two parts to this project. In the first part, we will analyse and compare the GDPs of various Indian states (both total and per capita). The GDP of a state is referred to as the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product). Then, we will categorise the states into four categories based on GDP per capita and, for each of these four categories, we will analyse the sectors which contribute most to the GDP (such as agriculture, real estate, manufacturing, etc.).

In the second part, we will analyse whether GDP per capita is related to drop out rates in schools and colleges.
